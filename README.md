# Virus Total API (Malware Analysis)

## Objective
This micro-project focused on conducting a thorough malware analysis using the VirusTotal API. By leveraging Python, I submitted malware samples and hashes from MalwareBazaar and VirusShare to VirusTotal. The responses provided detailed behavioral activities of the submitted samples, enhancing my understanding of malware analysis.
- To automate the submission of malware samples and hashes to VirusTotal using Python.
- To analyze the behavioral activities and responses from VirusTotal, including file modifications, API calls, scores, vendor verdicts, and C2 IP addresses.

## Tools and Technologies
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Programming Language: Python
- VirusTotal API: Version 3.0

## Implementation Details
Setup and Configuration
- Configured Visual Studio Code as the development environment.
- Installed necessary Python libraries for interacting with the VirusTotal API.

Data Sources
- MalwareBazaar: Collected malware samples and their respective hashes.
- VirusShare: Obtained additional malware samples and hashes for comprehensive analysis.

VirusTotal API Integration
- Implemented Python scripts to submit malware samples and hashes to VirusTotal using their API (v3.0).
- Utilized the API to retrieve detailed reports on each submitted sample.

Data Analysis
- Files Modified/Dropped: Identified changes made by the malware to the file system.
- API Calls: Analyzed the system calls made by the malware to understand its behavior.
- Base Score: Obtained the overall risk score assigned by VirusTotal.
- Community Score: Reviewed community feedback and scores for each sample.
- AV Vendor Verdict: Compiled the verdicts from various antivirus vendors.
- C2 IP Addresses: Extracted command-and-control server IP addresses associated with the malware.


## Results
- Successfully automated the submission of malware samples and hashes to VirusTotal.
- Retrieved and analyzed comprehensive behavioral reports for each malware sample.
- Gained insights into file modifications, API calls, base and community scores, antivirus vendor verdicts, and C2 IP addresses.

## Conclusion
This micro-project demonstrated the effective use of the VirusTotal API for malware analysis. The integration of Python scripts enabled automated submissions and detailed analysis of malware behavior, enhancing the overall understanding of malicious activities and their impacts.
